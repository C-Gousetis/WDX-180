  Your instructor will share the video lectures with you. The first part of the lecture is about Promises and error handling, while the second part is all about `scope` in JavaScript and different ways to define variables.  

  > A new term needs a proper Google search for its original definition:
  > 
  > **Scope:** *“the extent of the area or subject matter that something deals with or to which it is relevant.”*  
  > *Example: "we widened the scope of our investigation"*
