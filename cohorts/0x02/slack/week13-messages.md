# Slack Messages: Week 13 (08/01/2024 - 12/01/2024)

## 11/01/2024

  Here's the suggested plan for today.

  - Go through the content of Day 3 which contains a small debugging exercise and some advanced CSS. (Hey, JS is cool, but let's not forget that CSS and HTML can do quite a lot of things for us too).

  - Practice some of the things that we've learned yesterday

  - Dedicate some time to complete tasks for the group project and start preparing with your team for the final presentation (we suggest that it should be sometime next week)

  I suggest that in order to strengthen the knowledge that we've gained
  and also practice some HTML and CSS skills (we don't need them to get
  rusty just because of JS), recreate the table below in plain HTML and CSS.

  You can use some emojis for the :x: :white_check_mark: or you can recreate them using plain CSS!

  [Corss Mark](https://emojipedia.org/cross-mark){:target="_blank"}

  If you go with the CSS route for the symbols, you can use the following HTML entities
  and find some CSS rules to apply colors, background, borders, circles, etc. to these characters
  - `<span>&check;</span>`
  - `<span>&CircleTimes;</span>`

  [Unicode Character “✓” (U+2713)](https://www.compart.com/en/unicode/U+2713){:target="_blank"}

  You can of course, build the structure in many ways, but the `<table>` element is the most appropriate here.
  In case you've started building using another element, feel free to do so, and we'll check how different layouts
  and structure look later on.
